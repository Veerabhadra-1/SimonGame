# SimonGame
I am excited to share that I've recently built a fun Simon Says Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 🎮✨
This mini project was all about practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, and improving my frontend skills 💻
 It was super fun to build and even more fun to play! 😄
The tech stack I used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 🛠️
